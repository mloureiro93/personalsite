    <p class="app-description">
  Fast fashion is second only to oil as the world’s largest polluter. It emits 1.2 billion tons of CO2 equivalent per year.That’s more than the emissions created by air travel and international shipping It is also responsible for producing 20% of global wastewater.
  
  That's why we decided to try to help by creating a community based app that allows room for slow-fashion to grow.
  
  This MERN application is meant for store owners to promote their stores and interact with it's consumers and for regular users to share their experinces as well as find new ones.
  
  Want to help the planet and looking good while doing so?
  This project was created over the period of a week as part of a full-stack web development bootcamp.
